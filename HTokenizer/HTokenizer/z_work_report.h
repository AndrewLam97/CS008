    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
            
        -Implemented: Formatted Output with Top 100 and Bottom 100 Tokens
                      Max Heap Functions (Insert/GetMax/Pop)
                      Hash Table Functions (lookup/insertion)
                      File Tokenization using hard-coded internal FSM
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free I think. 

    Reflections:
        Not too bad, just had to create an interface layer between the hash table,
        heap, and file tokenizer. Very similar to our tree tokenizer, but I actually
        found this one easier to implement. I found looking up and inserting into a
        hash table to be a lot easier than an AVL. Something that was difficult was
        figuring out how to compare string hashes whilst still maintaining string
        integrity.
