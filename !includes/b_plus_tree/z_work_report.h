    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: The majority of the B+ Tree was the same as BTree, only real additions
    were creating and updating the links between leaf nodes. I anticipate remove will be
    more difficult due to this. My iterators don't work as of now. The BTree based map works
    correctly using my pair class. I didn't get around to completely finishing the multimap
    class, but it should in theory be the very similar except it returns vectors instead of
    T objects and the overloaded operators are a little different.
