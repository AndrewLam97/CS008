    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: 
            Max Heap using dynamic array
        -Partly implemented:

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: Hardest part was implementing the shifts. The dynamic array and its
    modifying functions portion was pretty easy. In my heap.cpp testing file, I
    forgot that that the elements in the array aren't actually stored in descending
    order so I needed to have two different print functions.
