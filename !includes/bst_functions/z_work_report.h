    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: BST Functions (insert, search, print, clear, etc)
            
        -Partly implemented: none

    Bugs     : Have one rare bug where erasing a node sometimes doesn't remove the old node

    Reflections:
        I ended up spending a lot of time on tree_erase and tree_print. I had to modify the search
        function a little bit so it would return the found node instead of a boolean.
