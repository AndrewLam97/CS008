            Array Functions

            Remove
            Tree Traversal and Printing
        -Partly implemented:
    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: Basically the same thing as a BTree that doesn't allow duplicates.
    Had to create a union function that created a union of two sets and an intersection
    function that got elements present in both sets.
