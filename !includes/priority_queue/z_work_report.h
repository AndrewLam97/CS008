    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: 
            Priority Queue using heap
        -Partly implemented:

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: Basically just a wrapper for our Heap class. I ended up overloading
    insert to take an info struct in addition to the separated item and priority
    arguments. I initially tried to figure out how to non-destructively print/iterate over
    the queue, but soon realized that could easily invalidate the ordering.
