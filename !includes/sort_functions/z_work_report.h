    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: 
            QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort
            Function Timing and Averaging functionalities
        -Partly implemented:

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: I found it interesting that even though all these algorithms
    have the same average time complexity of Î¸(n log(n) and worst case time complexity
    of O(n log(n)) (with the exception of Quick sort being O(n^2)), there were marked
    differences in runtime. QuickSort being faster than the other two implies to me
    that either I did not reach a worst case size where O(n^2) is markedly slower
    than O(n log(n)) or my implementation for the other two is inefficient. That being
    said, it did surprise me that QuickSort ended up being more than twice as fast
    as HeapSort.
