    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            Iterators
        -Implemented: 
            Pair
            MPair
            Map
            MMap

        -Partly implemented:
            
    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: Very similar to one another, pretty easy when
    btree and b+ trees are finished. Haven't finished iterators yet for
    multimap.
