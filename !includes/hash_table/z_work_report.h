    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: 
            Double Hash Table
            Chained Hash Table
            Interactive Testing for both Hash Tables
        -Partly implemented:
            Stress Test
    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: I actually found chained hash to be easier to implement than double hash.
    I think this was because I didn't have to worry about the extra information carried in
    the record struct. Individually dealing with the key and payload during insertion and
    extraction was more difficult than just pushing everything into an AVL for each key index.
    I didn't end up finishing the automated testing due to running out of time, but from the
    interactive test, both tables seem to work perfectly fine.
