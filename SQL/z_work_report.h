    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Multimap presentation
            
        -Implemented:
				SQL Class
                Infix to postfix conversion using shunting yard
                Batch File processing
                Manual commands

        -Partly implemented: B+ tree iterator

    Bugs     : Have a problem with my iterators somewhere in b+tree 

    Reflections:
        I spent a long time working on my B+ tree but wasn't able to iron out some bugs I guess. As a result,
        I am unable to run the multimap test without crashing. That aside, the SQL class works well
        and is able to correctly parse and run all the commands listed in the batch file as well as some that were 
        not, such as: select last, first from employee.
