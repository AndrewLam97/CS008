    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            Command Interpreter
        -Implemented: 
            Table CTORs
            insert
            select_all
            table printing

        -Partly implemented:
            conditional select
            Records
            
    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: Not bad once the initial structure was figured out. Didn't get
    around to conditional select though it shouldn't be too difficult to use a 
    map to store the correct index to grab. I also need to finish implementing
    using a Record as an intermediary envelope for the table. I changed the Record
    class to be 2D but I'm still not sure how exactly we're supposed to use binary 
    files in the table context.
