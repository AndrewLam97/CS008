    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            Iterators
        -Implemented: 
            Array Functions
            Insert
            Remove
            Tree Traversal and Printing
        -Partly implemented:
            DFS traversal and print
            Auto stress test
    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: Rotates were hard. Using the visualizer online helped a lot
    with figuring out which children and keys should be moving where. Merging
    and fix shortage weren't too bad. I implemented in-order traversal, but my 
    dfs traversal is broken. I've still got to implement some miscellaneous 
    functionalities, but the core of the btree works.
