    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Did not implement iterators,
            need to review iterators.
        -Implemented: linked list functions, stack and queue templated classes
            and functions.
        -Partly implemented: Insert functions.
            Implemented necessary insertion functions, did not implement optional
            ones such as insert_before.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        Copy_list function was the hardest for me to implement, kept seg faulting
        due to not checking/keeping track of walker traversal.
