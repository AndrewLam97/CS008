    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
            
        -Implemented: Return of token from file using extraction operator
            Hard-coded internal FSM
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free I think. Number of
               tokens seems a little off but I'm not sure.

    Reflections:
        Took me a little time to design the interface between the STK and file.
        Ended up not using some of the included member variables. I also had to
        slightly modify solitude.txt as there were some weird characters/spaces
        or something that was messing up my code.
