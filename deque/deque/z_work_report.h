    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Did not implement iterators
    
        -Implemented: double ended queue functionality (push from either end,
            pop from either end, access item from either end)

        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        popRear() gave me the most difficulty as I kept seg faulting due to not
        updating my push functions to include the new beginning and end links.
