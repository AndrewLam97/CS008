    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: 
            AVL Functions (rotates, insert, search, print, clear, etc)
            AVL Class with Big 3 Functions
            Interactive Command Line Interface
        -Partly implemented: I think there might be a bug when inserting in a very niche order

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections: Having already written the BST class and functions, the large majority of the
    class and its functions were already mostly done. Creating the rotate functions wasn't too
    difficult when following the algorithms. The part I had the most difficulty with was tree_insert
    and adding the second decision making block that dealt with balance factor and calling the right
    rotations.
