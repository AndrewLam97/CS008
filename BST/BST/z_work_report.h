    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: BST Class with Big 3 Functions
            Interactive Command Line Function
        -Partly implemented: none

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        95% of my time was spent on bst_functions. The BST class ended up just making calls to the aforementioned
        functions. The most complex part of writing the class itself was remembering how to overload operators.
        Please see the work report for bst_functions.
