    Features:
        -Not Implemented: 
            
        -Implemented: Heap Implementation to find top 100 words
            AVL tree
            Return of token from string using extraction operator
            Hard-coded internal FSM
        -Partly implemented: none

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free I think

    Reflections:
        Somewhat difficult as I had to go back and fix some implementations in my previous classes.
        The problems mostly arose from the interface layer between the AVL and TTokenizer.
        My AVL tree had an issue with inserting the new structure which I had to fix. I also had 
        an issue with figuring out how to insert and find based on the key value pair. Past that, inserting
        into the heap and grabbing the top 100 words wasn't too difficult.
